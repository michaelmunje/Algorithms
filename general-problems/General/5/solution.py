# General Problem 5:
# Find the only element in an array that only occurs once.

# Solution:
# Store the array into a dictionary while counting the occurences
# Then print out values that occur once, if there is exactly one

# function printOneCount
# Takes an array of integers as the input
# Outputs the element that is repeated exactly once
def printOneCount(arr):
	myDict = dict()
	for i in arr:
		myDict[i] = myDict.get(i,0) + 1
	arrMax = min(myDict, key=myDict.get)
	lengthOne = list()
	for key, value in myDict.items():
    	  if (value == 1):
    	  	lengthOne.insert(len(lengthOne),key)
	if (len(lengthOne) == 1):
		print(arrMax)
	else:
		print("There is not exactly one element that occurs once.")
