Trees

  1. Implement a BST with insert and delete functions

  2. Print a tree using BFS and DFS

  3. Write a function that determines if a tree is a BST

  4. Find the smallest element in a BST

  5. Find the 2nd largest number in a BST

  6. Given a binary tree which is a sum tree (child nodes add to parent), write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree

  7. Find the distance between 2 nodes in a BST and a normal binary tree

  8. Print the coordinates of every node in a binary tree, where root is 0,0

  9. Print a tree by levels

  10. Given a binary tree which is a sum tree, write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree

  11. Given a tree, verify that it contains a subtree.

  12. HARD: Find the max distance between 2 nodes in a BST.

  13. HARD: Construct a BST given the pre-order and in-order traversal Strings
