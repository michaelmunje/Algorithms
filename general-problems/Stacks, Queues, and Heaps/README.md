Stacks, Queues, and Heaps

  1. Implement a stack with push and pop functions

  2. Implement a queue with queue and dequeue functions

  3. Find the minimum element in a stack in O(1) time

  4. Write a function that sorts a stack (bonus: sort the stack in place without extra memory)

  5. Implement a binary min heap. Turn it into a binary max heap

  6. HARD: Implement a queue using 2 stacks
